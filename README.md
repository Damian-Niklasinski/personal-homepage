## General Informations

In this project you can get to know my front-end skills and see what I would like to learn in the future. The purpose of the website is to show that I can create it aesthetically and that everything works together. You will also find all my contact details and social media links.

I also added all my projects from the GitHub repository using its API.

The repository loading stage has also been added. When an error occurs, we will receive an appropriate message.
